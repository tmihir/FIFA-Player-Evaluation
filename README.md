* Elminated columns using correlation matrix
* Implemented linear regression with penalization (Lasso, Ridge) to verify model is over fitted or not
* Built models were tested using test data from simple to ensemble machine learning models
* Received the highest prediction rate in XGBoosting Regressor
* Concluded project with simple neural network algorithm
